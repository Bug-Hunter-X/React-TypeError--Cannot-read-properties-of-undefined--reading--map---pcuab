# React TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` error that occurs when trying to map over an array that may be null or undefined. This typically happens when fetching data asynchronously and the data hasn't been fetched before the component attempts to render the data.

## Description:
The bug occurs because the component calls `.map()` on the `data` state before the data is loaded.  If the initial state or an empty response results in `data` being `null` or `undefined`, the `.map()` method will throw an error.

## Solution:
The solution involves adding a check to ensure that `data` is an array and is not empty before calling `.map()`.  Additionally, proper error handling for cases when the API call fails is also implemented.

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the error in the console when the component first renders, and then see how the error is resolved after the data loads.
